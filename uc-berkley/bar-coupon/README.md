## Practical Application 1

This data analysis looks into seeking out whether the customer will accept the coupon

### Initial Findings

Based on the analysis the number of people who accepted the "bar" coupon is low when compared
to the entire dataset. I'ved noted the acceptance rate as a percentage based on the conditionals
that were set.

### Other Analysis

* I decided to look at what individuals accepted a specific coupon based on income and noticed that
people with typically lower incomes accepted coupons to higher degree than those with higher income.
Since the income of $50,000 - $62,500 was the median, I used that as the cut off between low income
and high income.

* I looked at the data with ```sns.pairplot()``` to see if there was any correlation that may exists, but did not
find any correlation (not included in notebook).

* I also visual looked at other numerical data that was given, such as distribution of age,
occupation based on gender, and income.
