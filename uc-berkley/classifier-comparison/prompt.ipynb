    "\n",
    "Despite not being able to get the best param fit time for the `SVC` classifer, I would say this is classifier performed best overall just by looking at the scores. I have a strong feeling that the fit time would be the lowest number as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I did not include any plots as the objective of this practial application assignment was to assess the best classifer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "If I did not have the CPU limitations on my computer, I could further my analysis by incorporating additional hyperparameters and cross-validation as well with `GridSearchCV`. Also, `GridSearchCV` has an attribute `cv_results_` that can be used to dive even deeper into the analysis of the hyperparameters."
